| 1) **LLMs Represent Space and Time** - discovers that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales; the representations are robust to prompt variations and unified across different entity types; demonstrate that LLMs acquire fundamental structured knowledge such as space and time, claiming that language models learn beyond superficial statistics, but literal world models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02207), [Tweet](https://x.com/wesg52/status/1709551516577902782?s=20)         |
| 2) **Retrieval meets Long Context LLMs** - compares retrieval augmentation and long-context windows for downstream tasks to investigate if the methods can be combined to get the best of both worlds; an LLM with a 4K context window using simple RAG can achieve comparable performance to a fine-tuned LLM with 16K context; retrieval can significantly improve the performance of LLMs regardless of their extended context window sizes; a retrieval-augmented LLaMA2-70B with a 32K context window outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo-16k on seven long context tasks including question answering and query-based summarization.                                                                                          | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03025), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709749178199318545?s=20)       |
| 3) **StreamingLLM** - a framework that enables efficient streaming LLMs with attention sinks, a phenomenon where the KV states of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention; the emergence of the attention sink is due to strong attention scores towards the initial tokens; this approach enables LLMs trained with finite length attention windows to generalize to infinite sequence length without any additional fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453), [Tweet](https://x.com/Guangxuan_Xiao/status/1708943505731801325?s=20) |

| 6) **Training LLMs with Pause Tokens** - performs training and inference on LLMs with a learnable <pause> token which helps to delay the model's answer generation and attain performance gains on general understanding tasks of Commonsense QA and math word problem-solving; experiments show that this is only beneficial provided that the delay is introduced in both pertaining and downstream fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02226), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709573238123122959?s=20)       |
| 7) **Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation** - proposes the use of a language model-infused scaffolding program to recursively improve itself; a seed improver first improves an input program that returns the best solution which is then further tasked to improve itself; shows that the GPT-4 models can write code that can call itself to improve itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02304), [Tweet](https://x.com/ericzelikman/status/1709721771937587541?s=20)   |
| 8) **Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning** - proposes a lightweight fine-tuning method to retrofit LLMs with retrieval capabilities; it involves a 2-step approach: 1) updates a pretrained LM to better use the retrieved information 2) updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM Results show that fine-tuning over tasks that require both knowledge utilization and contextual awareness, each stage leads to additional gains; a 65B model achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of knowledge-intensive zero- and few-shot learning benchmarks; it outperforms existing retrieval-augmented language approaches by up to +8.9% in zero-shot and +1.4% in 5-shot. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01352), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709204756013490494?s=20)       |

| 10) **Analogical Prompting** - a new prompting approach to automatically guide the reasoning process of LLMs; the approach is different from chain-of-thought in that it doesn’t require labeled exemplars of the reasoning process; the approach is inspired by analogical reasoning and prompts LMs to self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge in the context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01714), [Tweet](https://x.com/michiyasunaga/status/1709582150025240854?s=20)  |
