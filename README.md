## Top ML Papers of the Week (December 9 - December 15) - 2024
| **Paper**  | **Links** | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| 1) Training LLMs to Reason in a Continuous Latent Space - presents Coconut (Chain of Continuous Thought), a novel paradigm that enables LLMs to reason in continuous latent space rather than natural language; Coconut takes the last hidden state of the LLM as the reasoning state and feeds it back to the LLM as the subsequent input embedding directly in the continuous space; this leads to what the authors refer to as "continuous thought" which augments an LLM's capability on reasoning tasks; it demonstrates improved performance on complex reasoning tasks through emergent breadth-first search capabilities.| [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06769), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1866518791733342563)|
| 2) Phi-4 Technical Report - presents phi-4, a 14B model that surpasses its teacher model on STEM-QA capabilities. It also reports strong performance on reasoning-focused benchmarks due to improved data, training curriculum, and innovations in the post-training scheme.| [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08905), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1867609628529635574)|
| 3) Asynchronous Function Calling - proposes AsyncLM, a system for asynchronous LLM function calling; they design an in-context protocol for function calls and interrupts, provide fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs to the interrupt semantics, and implement these mechanisms efficiently on LLM inference process; AsyncLM can reduce task completion latency from 1.6x-5.4x compared to synchronous function calling; it enables LLMs to generate and execute function calls concurrently.| [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07017), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1866855077983686804)|
| 4) MAG-V - a multi-agent framework that first generates a dataset of questions that mimic customer queries; it then reverse engineers alternate questions from responses to verify agent trajectories; reports that the generated synthetic data can improve agent performance on actual customer queries; finds that for trajectory verification simple ML baselines with feature engineering can match the performance of more expensive and capable models.| [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04494), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1866143542726340890)|
| 5) Clio - proposes a platform using AI assistants to analyze and surface private aggregated usage patterns from millions of Claude conversations; enables insights into real-world AI use while protecting user privacy; the system helps identify usage trends, safety risks, and coordinated misuse attempts without human reviewers needing to read raw conversations. | [Paper](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/7e1ab885d1b24176/original/Clio-Privacy-Preserving-Insights-into-Real-World-AI-Use.pdf), [Tweet](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1867325190352576780)|
| 6) A Survey on LLMs-as-Judges - presents a comprehensive survey of the LLMs-as-judges paradigm from five key perspectives: Functionality, Methodology, Applications, Meta-evaluation, and Limitations.| [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05579), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1866541394015518824)|
| 7) AutoReason Improves Multi-step Reasoning - proposes a method to automatically generate rationales for queries using CoT prompting; this transforms zero-shot queries into few-shot reasoning traces which are used as CoT exemplars by the LLM; claims to improve reasoning in weaker LLMs. |[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06975), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1867224350287372555)|
| 8) The Byte Latent Transformer (BLT)- introduces a byte-level language model architecture that matches tokenization-based LLM performance while improving efficiency and robustness; uses a dynamic method of grouping bytes into patches based on the entropy of the next byte, allocating more compute resources to complex predictions while using larger patches for more predictable sequences; BLT demonstrates the ability to match or exceed the performance of models like Llama 3 while using up to 50% fewer FLOPs during inference.| [Paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/byte-latent-transformer-patches-scale-better-than-tokens/), [Tweet](https://x.com/ArtidoroPagnoni/status/1867601413741981804)|
| 9) Does RLHF Scale? - This new paper explores the impacts of key components in the RLHF framework. Summary of main findings: 1) RLHF doesn't scale as effectively as pretraining in LLMs, with larger policy models benefiting less from RLHF when using a fixed reward model, 2)when increasing the number of responses sampled per prompt during policy training, performance improves initially but plateaus quickly, typically around 4-8 samples, 3) using larger reward models leads to better performance in reasoning tasks, but the improvements can be inconsistent across different types of tasks, and 4) increasing training data diversity for reward models is more effective than increasing response diversity per prompt, but policy training shows diminishing returns after the early stages regardless of additional data. |[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06000), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1866525606562680954)|
| 10) Granite Guardian - IBM open-sources Granite Guardian, a suite of safeguards for risk detection in LLMs; the authors claim that With AUC scores of 0.871 and 0.854 on harmful content and RAG-hallucination-related benchmarks respectively, Granite Guardian is the most generalizable and competitive model available in the space. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07724), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1866852443621036228)|

| 1) **AlphaQubit** - a new AI-based decoder that sets a state-of-the-art benchmark for identifying errors in quantum computers; using transformer architecture, AlphaQubit demonstrated 6% fewer errors than tensor network methods and 30% fewer errors than correlated matching when tested on the Sycamore data; shows promising results in simulations of larger systems up to 241 qubits; while this represents significant progress in quantum error correction, the system still needs improvements in speed before it can correct errors in real-time for practical quantum computing applications.  | [Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08148-8), [Tweet](https://x.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/1859273133234192598) |

| 3) **A Statistical Approach to LLM Evaluation** - proposes five key statistical recommendations for a more rigorous evaluation of LLM performance differences. The recommendations include: 1) using the Central Limit Theorem to measure theoretical averages across all possible questions rather than just observed averages; 2) clustering standard errors when questions are related rather than independent; 3) reducing variance within questions through resampling or using next-token probabilities; 4) analyzing paired differences between models since questions are shared across evaluations, and 5) using power analysis to determine appropriate sample sizes for detecting meaningful differences between models; the authors argue that these statistical approaches will help researchers better determine whether performance differences between models represent genuine capability gaps or are simply due to chance, leading to more precise and reliable model evaluations.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00640), [Tweet](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1858976458330505639) |

| 6) **Cut Your Losses in Large-Vocabulary Language Models** - introduces Cut Cross-Entropy (CCE), a novel method to significantly reduce memory usage during LLM training by optimizing how the cross-entropy loss is computed; currently, the cross-entropy layer in LLM training consumes a disproportionate amount of memory (up to 90% in some models) due to storing logits for all possible vocabulary tokens. CCE addresses this by only computing logits for the correct token and evaluating the log-sum-exp over all logits on the fly using flash memory; the authors show that the approach reduces the memory footprint of Gemma 2 from 24GB to just 1MB; the method leverages the inherent sparsity of softmax calculations to skip elements that contribute negligibly to gradients; finally, it demonstrates that CCE achieves this dramatic memory reduction without sacrificing training speed or convergence, enabling larger batch sizes during training and potentially more efficient scaling of LLM training.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09009) |

However, the performance is below experienced human researchers.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11910v1),  [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1859656533489188928)  |
| 8) **Does Prompt Formatting Impact LLM Performance** - examines how different prompt formats (plain text, Markdown, JSON, and YAML) affect GPT model performance across various tasks; finds that GPT-3.5-turbo's performance can vary by up to 40% depending on the prompt format, while larger models like GPT-4 show more robustness to format changes; argues that there is no universally optimal format across models or tasks - for instance, GPT-3.5-turbo generally performed better with JSON formats while GPT-4 preferred Markdown; models from the same family showed similar format preferences, but these preferences didn't transfer well between different model families; suggests that prompt formatting significantly impacts model performance and should be carefully considered when performing prompt engineering and model evaluation, and how to apply it to applications. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10541)  |
| 9) **FinRobot** - an AI agent framework for equity research that uses a multi-agent Chain-of-Thought prompting, combining data analysis with human-like reasoning to produce professional investment reports comparable to major brokerages; it leverage three agents: a Data-CoT Agent to aggregate diverse data sources for robust financial integration; the Concept-CoT Agent, for analyst’s reasoning to generate actionable insights; and the Thesis-CoT Agent to synthesizes these insights into a coherent investment thesis and report. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08804)  |

| **Paper**  | **Links** | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| 1) **Impacts of AI on Innovation** - suggests that top scientists leverage their domain knowledge to prioritize promising AI suggestions, while others waste significant resources testing false positives; finds that implementing AI materials discovery technology leads to substantial increases in productivity, with 44% more materials discovered, 39% more patent filings, and 17% more product innovation; reports that these gains came with concerning tradeoffs, as 82% of scientists reported reduced job satisfaction due to decreased creativity and skill underutilization.  | [Paper](https://aidantr.github.io/files/AI_innovation.pdf), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1856424446720127024) |
| 2) **Scaling Laws for Precision** - introduces "precision-aware" scaling laws that predict how model performance is affected by both training and inference precision in LLMs; key findings include: 1) post-training quantization becomes more harmful as models are trained on more data, eventually making additional pretraining actively detrimental, 2) training in lower precision requires increasing model size to maintain performance, and 3) when jointly optimizing model size, data, and precision, the compute-optimal training precision is around 7-8 bits and independent of compute; also reports that when the model size is fixed, compute-optimal precision increases approximately logarithmically with data; the authors validate their predictions on models up to 1.7B parameters trained on up to 26B tokens, showing that both very high (16-bit) and very low (sub 4-bit) training precisions may be suboptimal.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04330), [Tweet](https://x.com/tanishqkumar07/status/1856045600355352753) |

| 5) **The Surprising Effectiveness of Test-Time Training for Abstract Reasoning** - explores test-time training (TTT) - updating model parameters temporarily during inference - for improving an LLM's abstract reasoning capabilities using the ARC benchmark; identifies three crucial components: initial fine-tuning on similar tasks, auxiliary task format and augmentations, and per-instance training; TTT significantly improves performance, achieving up to 6x improvement in accuracy compared to base fine-tuned models; when applying TTT to an 8B LLM, they achieve 53% accuracy on ARC's public validation set, improving the state-of-the-art for neural approaches by nearly 25%; by ensembling their method with program generation approaches, they achieve state-of-the-art public validation accuracy of 61.9%, matching average human performance; the findings suggest that explicit symbolic search is not the only path to improved abstract reasoning in LLMs; test-time training applied to continued training on few-shot examples can be highly effective.   | [Paper](https://ekinakyurek.github.io/papers/ttt.pdf), [Tweet](https://x.com/akyurekekin/status/1855680785715478546) |

| 7) **Toward Optimal Search and Retrieval for RAG** - examines how retrieval affects performance in RAG pipelines for QA tasks; conducts experiments using BGE-base and ColBERT retrievers with LLaMA and Mistral, finding that including more gold (relevant) documents improves QA accuracy; finds that using approximate nearest neighbor search with lower recall only minimally impacts performance while potentially improving speed and memory efficiency; reports that adding noisy or irrelevant documents consistently degrades performance, contradicting previous research claims; concludes that optimizing retrieval of gold documents is crucial for RAG performance, and that operating at lower search accuracy levels can be a viable approach for practical applications. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07396),  [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1856709865802252710)  |
| 8) **Mitigating LLM Jailbreaks with Few Examples** - introduces a new approach called for defending LLMs against jailbreak attacks, focusing on quickly adapting defenses after detecting new attacks rather than aiming for perfect adversarial upfront robustness; using a new benchmark, the most effective method, based on fine-tuning an input classifier, reduced attack success rates by over 240x for known attack types and 15x for novel variations after seeing just one example of each attack strategy; demonstrates that rapidly responding to new jailbreaks can be an effective alternative to traditional static defenses.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07494),  [Tweet](https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1856752093945540673)  |
| 9) **Mixture of Transformers** - introduce Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a new sparse multi-modal transformer architecture that matches the performance of traditional models while using only about half the computational resources for text and image processing; MoT matches a dense baseline's performance using only 55.8% of the FLOPs.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04996)  |
| 10) **HtmlRAG** - a novel approach that proposes using HTML instead of plain text as the format for building RAG systems; the key finding is that preserving HTML structure provides richer semantic and structural information compared to plain text conversion, which typically loses important formatting like headings, tables, and semantic tags; to address the challenge of HTML documents being too long for LLM context windows, the authors develop a two-step pruning method: first cleaning unnecessary HTML elements (reducing length by 94%), then using a block-tree-based pruning approach that combines embedding-based and generative pruning to further reduce the content while maintaining important information; experiments across six different QA datasets demonstrate that HtmlRAG outperforms existing plain-text based methods, validating the advantages of preserving HTML structure in RAG systems.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02959v1), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1857870511302390013) |

| 7) **Improving Retrieval-Augmented LMs with Compressors** - presents two approaches to compress retrieved documents into text summaries before pre-pending them in-context: 1) extractive compressor - selects useful sentences from retrieved documents 2) abstractive compressor - generates summaries by synthesizing information from multiple documents; achieves a compression rate of as low as 6% with minimal loss in performance on language modeling tasks and open domain question answering tasks; the proposed training scheme performs selective augmentation which helps to generate empty summaries when retrieved docs are irrelevant or unhelpful for a task. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04408), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1711384213092479130?s=20)      |
| 8) **Instruct-Retro** - introduces Retro 48B, the largest LLM pretrained with retrieval; continues pretraining a 43B parameter GPT model on an additional 100B tokens by retrieving from 1.2T tokens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07713), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1712466049428521433?s=20)      |
| 9) **MemWalker** - a method to enhance long-text understanding by treating the LLM as an interactive agent that can decide how to read the text via iterative prompting; it first processes long context into a tree of summer nodes and reads in a query to traverse the tree, seeking relevant information and crafting a suitable response; this process is achieved through reasoning and enables effective reading and enhances explainability through reasoning steps.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05029), [Tweet](https://x.com/__howardchen/status/1711584916708938042?s=20)  |
| 10) **Toward Language Agent Fine-tuning** - explores the direction of fine-tuning LLMs to obtain language agents; finds that language agents consistently improved after fine-tuning their backbone language model; claims that fine-tuning a Llama2-7B with 500 agent trajectories                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05915), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1711757242905534479?s=20)      |

| 1) **LLMs Represent Space and Time** - discovers that LLMs learn linear representations of space and time across multiple scales; the representations are robust to prompt variations and unified across different entity types; demonstrate that LLMs acquire fundamental structured knowledge such as space and time, claiming that language models learn beyond superficial statistics, but literal world models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02207), [Tweet](https://x.com/wesg52/status/1709551516577902782?s=20)         |
| 2) **Retrieval meets Long Context LLMs** - compares retrieval augmentation and long-context windows for downstream tasks to investigate if the methods can be combined to get the best of both worlds; an LLM with a 4K context window using simple RAG can achieve comparable performance to a fine-tuned LLM with 16K context; retrieval can significantly improve the performance of LLMs regardless of their extended context window sizes; a retrieval-augmented LLaMA2-70B with a 32K context window outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo-16k on seven long context tasks including question answering and query-based summarization.                                                                                          | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03025), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709749178199318545?s=20)       |
| 3) **StreamingLLM** - a framework that enables efficient streaming LLMs with attention sinks, a phenomenon where the KV states of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention; the emergence of the attention sink is due to strong attention scores towards the initial tokens; this approach enables LLMs trained with finite length attention windows to generalize to infinite sequence length without any additional fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453), [Tweet](https://x.com/Guangxuan_Xiao/status/1708943505731801325?s=20) |

| 6) **Training LLMs with Pause Tokens** - performs training and inference on LLMs with a learnable <pause> token which helps to delay the model's answer generation and attain performance gains on general understanding tasks of Commonsense QA and math word problem-solving; experiments show that this is only beneficial provided that the delay is introduced in both pertaining and downstream fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02226), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709573238123122959?s=20)       |
| 7) **Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation** - proposes the use of a language model-infused scaffolding program to recursively improve itself; a seed improver first improves an input program that returns the best solution which is then further tasked to improve itself; shows that the GPT-4 models can write code that can call itself to improve itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02304), [Tweet](https://x.com/ericzelikman/status/1709721771937587541?s=20)   |
| 8) **Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning** - proposes a lightweight fine-tuning method to retrofit LLMs with retrieval capabilities; it involves a 2-step approach: 1) updates a pretrained LM to better use the retrieved information 2) updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM Results show that fine-tuning over tasks that require both knowledge utilization and contextual awareness, each stage leads to additional gains; a 65B model achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of knowledge-intensive zero- and few-shot learning benchmarks; it outperforms existing retrieval-augmented language approaches by up to +8.9% in zero-shot and +1.4% in 5-shot. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01352), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709204756013490494?s=20)       |
