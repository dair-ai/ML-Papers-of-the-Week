| 5) **Stealing Part of a Production Language Model** - presents the first model-stealing attack that extracts information from production language models like ChatGPT or PaLM-2; shows that it's possible to recover the embedding projection layer of a transformer-based model through typical API access; as an example, the entire projection matrix was extracted from the OpenAI ada and babbage models for under $20.   | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06634), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1767641831079067694?s=20) |
| 6) **Branch-Train-MiX** - proposes mixing expert LLMs into a Mixture-of-Experts LLM as a more compute-efficient approach for training LLMs; it's shown to be more efficient than training a larger generalist LLM or several separate specialized LLMs; the approach, BTX, first trains (in parallel) multiple copies of a seed LLM specialized in different domains (i.e., expert LLMs) and merges them into a single LLM using MoE feed-forward layers, followed by fine-tuning of the overall unified model. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07816),  [Tweet](https://x.com/jaseweston/status/1767727740952682667?s=20)  |
| 7) **LLMs Predict Neuroscience Results** - proposes a benchmark, BrainBench, for evaluating the ability of LLMs to predict neuroscience results; finds that LLMs surpass experts in predicting experimental outcomes; an LLM tuned on neuroscience literature was shown to perform even better. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03230),  [Tweet](https://x.com/ProfData/status/1765689739682754824?s=20)  |
| 8) **C4AI Command-R** - a 35B parameter model, with a context length of 128K, optimized for use cases that include reasoning, summarization, and question answering; Command-R has the capability for multilingual generation evaluated in 10 languages and performant tool use and RAG capabilities; it has been released for research purposes. | [Paper](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01),  [Tweet](https://x.com/CohereForAI/status/1767275927505977455?s=20)  |
| 9) **Is Cosine-Similarity Really About Simirity?** - studies embeddings derived from regularized linear models and derive analytically how cosine-similarity can yield arbitrary and meaningless similarities; also finds that for some linear models, the similarities are not even unique and others are controlled by regularization; the authors caution against blindly using cosine similarity and presents considerations and alternatives.  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05440), [Tweet](https://x.com/_reachsumit/status/1767045820384477575?s=20)  |
| 10) **Multimodal LLM Pre-training** - provides a comprehensive overview of methods, analysis, and insights into multimodal LLM pre-training; studies different architecture components and finds that carefully mixing image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is key for state-of-the-art performance; it also proposes a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters that achieve SOTA in pre-training metrics and include properties such as enhanced in-context learning, multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot chain-of-thought prompting. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09611), [Tweet](https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/1769053019939967080?s=20) |

## Top ML Papers of the Week (March 4 - March 10) - 2024
| **Paper**  | **Links** |

| 4) **Can LLMs Reason and Plan?** - a new position paper discusses the topic of reasoning and planning for LLMs; here is a summary of the author's conclusion: "To summarize, nothing that I have read, verified, or done gives me any compelling reason to believe that LLMs do reasoning/planning, as normally understood. What they do instead, armed with web-scale training, is a form of universal approximate retrieval, which, as I have argued, can sometimes be mistaken for reasoning capabilities".  | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04121), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1766123621326475285?s=20) |

| 2) **Retrieval meets Long Context LLMs** - compares retrieval augmentation and long-context windows for downstream tasks to investigate if the methods can be combined to get the best of both worlds; an LLM with a 4K context window using simple RAG can achieve comparable performance to a fine-tuned LLM with 16K context; retrieval can significantly improve the performance of LLMs regardless of their extended context window sizes; a retrieval-augmented LLaMA2-70B with a 32K context window outperforms GPT-3.5-turbo-16k on seven long context tasks including question answering and query-based summarization.                                                                                          | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03025), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709749178199318545?s=20)       |
| 3) **StreamingLLM** - a framework that enables efficient streaming LLMs with attention sinks, a phenomenon where the KV states of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention; the emergence of the attention sink is due to strong attention scores towards the initial tokens; this approach enables LLMs trained with finite length attention windows to generalize to infinite sequence length without any additional fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17453), [Tweet](https://x.com/Guangxuan_Xiao/status/1708943505731801325?s=20) |

| 6) **Training LLMs with Pause Tokens** - performs training and inference on LLMs with a learnable <pause> token which helps to delay the model's answer generation and attain performance gains on general understanding tasks of Commonsense QA and math word problem-solving; experiments show that this is only beneficial provided that the delay is introduced in both pertaining and downstream fine-tuning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02226), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709573238123122959?s=20)       |
| 7) **Recursively Self-Improving Code Generation** - proposes the use of a language model-infused scaffolding program to recursively improve itself; a seed improver first improves an input program that returns the best solution which is then further tasked to improve itself; shows that the GPT-4 models can write code that can call itself to improve itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02304), [Tweet](https://x.com/ericzelikman/status/1709721771937587541?s=20)   |
| 8) **Retrieval-Augmented Dual Instruction Tuning** - proposes a lightweight fine-tuning method to retrofit LLMs with retrieval capabilities; it involves a 2-step approach: 1) updates a pretrained LM to better use the retrieved information 2) updates the retriever to return more relevant results, as preferred by the LM Results show that fine-tuning over tasks that require both knowledge utilization and contextual awareness, each stage leads to additional gains; a 65B model achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of knowledge-intensive zero- and few-shot learning benchmarks; it outperforms existing retrieval-augmented language approaches by up to +8.9% in zero-shot and +1.4% in 5-shot. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01352), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709204756013490494?s=20)       |
| 9) **KOSMOG-G** - a model that performs high-fidelity zero-shot image generation from generalized vision-language input that spans multiple images; extends zero-shot subject-driven image generation to multi-entity scenarios; allows the replacement of CLIP, unlocking new applications with other U-Net techniques such as ControlNet and LoRA.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02992), [Tweet](https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1709934741158510625?s=20)       |
| 10) **Analogical Prompting** - a new prompting approach to automatically guide the reasoning process of LLMs; the approach is different from chain-of-thought in that it doesn’t require labeled exemplars of the reasoning process; the approach is inspired by analogical reasoning and prompts LMs to self-generate relevant exemplars or knowledge in the context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01714), [Tweet](https://x.com/michiyasunaga/status/1709582150025240854?s=20)  |
